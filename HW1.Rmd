## Monthly precipitation 

This is a boxplot showing the montly precipitation observed in the area considering data from `r min(climate$year)` to `r max(climate$year)`.

```{r precipitation, echo=FALSE}

#Monthly precipitation

boxplot(climate$rain ~ climate$month,
ylab="Precipitation (mm)",
xlab="Month", col="blue")
```

## Mean monthly temperature 

This is a boxplot showing the avreage monthly temperature in the area considering data from `r min(climate$year)` to `r max(climate$year)`. Average temperature was estimated as the mean of the max and min temperatures. 

```{r average rain, echo=FALSE}

#Monthly average temperature

climate$avg.temp = (climate$tmin+climate$tmax)/2

boxplot(climate$avg.temp ~ climate$month,
ylab="Average Temperature (C)",
xlab="Month", col="orange")


```

```{r finding the wettest and the dryest years, echo = FALSE}

Year.Rain = aggregate(climate$rain, by = list(climate$year), sum)
min.Rain = which.min(Year.Rain$x)
Year.min = Year.Rain[min.Rain,1]
max.Rain = which.max(Year.Rain$x)
Year.max = Year.Rain[max.Rain,1]

```

## The wettest and the dryest years

The wettest year between `r min(climate$year)` and `r max(climate$year)` was `r Year.max` with a total precipitation of `r max.Rain` mm while the dryest year during the same period, was `r Year.min` with a total precipitation of `r min.Rain`.

## How does a wet and a dry year look in a Costa Rican Forest?

Here is a picture from a forest in the Guanacaste region in Costa Rica contrasting the wet and the dry seasons (Source: [Guanacaste dry forest conservation fund](http://www.gdfcf.org/biodiversity-species))

```{r}
#Defining seasons 

climate$season = ifelse(climate$month == 4|climate$month == 5|climate$month == 6, 'spring', ifelse (climate$month == 7|climate$month == 8|climate$month == 9, 'summer',ifelse(climate$month == 10|climate$month == 11|climate$month == 12, 'fall' , 'winter')))

#Finding the wettest and dryest season

rain.season = aggregate(climate$rain, by= list(climate$season), sum)
rain.dry.season = which.min(rain.season$x)
dry.season = rain.season[rain.dry.season,1]
rain.wet.season = which.max(rain.season$x)
wet.season = rain.season[rain.wet.season,1]

```

## The wettest and the dryest seasons

The wettest season in this ecosystem is  `r wet.season` with an accumulated total precipitation of `r rain.wet.season` mm, between `r min(climate$year)` and `r max(climate$year)`. While the dryest season during the same period, was `r dry.season` with a accumulated total precipitation of `r rain.dry.season`.
